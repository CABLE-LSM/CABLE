! Purpose: Converts selected CABLE hydrology variables to UM variables for 
!          UM hydrology code
!
! Called from: UM code hydrol
!
! Contact: Jhan.Srbinovsky@csiro.au
!
! History: Written for CABLE v1.8. No change for CABLE v2.0
!          In future could be combined with standard unpacking of cable 
!          variables at end of implicit call
