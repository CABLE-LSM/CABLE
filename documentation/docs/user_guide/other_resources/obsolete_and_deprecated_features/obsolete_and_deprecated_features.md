# Obsolete and deprecated features for CABLE users #

The obsolete user features described here were at some point valid in previous
versions of CABLE before they became deprecated and were subsequently removed
from the code. Attempts to use such features in runs of current versions of CABLE
should result in general in an error message. Usage of the deprecated user features described here is discouraged as they are scheduled to become obsolete
and removed from future versions of CABLE. Attempts to use such features in runs of current versions of CABLE
should result in general in a warning message.
