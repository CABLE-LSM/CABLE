## Descriptive table of parameters

!!! Note "JULES implementation"

    In JULES, all namelist variables are initialised with a missing data indicator (MDI). The MDI value varies according to the type of the namelist variable.

| Namelist variable | Type              | Available values | Default values | Description                                                                                  |
