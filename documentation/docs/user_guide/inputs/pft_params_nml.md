In CABLE the characteristics of the vegetation cover are parametrised and generally remain constant throughout the simulation. These **vegetation parameters** in general vary by **vegetation type**.
CABLE supports tiling of vegetation, i.e. multiple vegetation types with specified area fractions for a single location/grid-cell (also referred to as patches in CABLE). 
Altogether CABLE considers the 17 distinct types of vegetation cover listed in Table 1.
Eleven of those are plant functional types (PFT), two are generally unoccupied, and the remaining four are not vegetated. 

## Table 1: CABLE vegetation types

| Number |        Type          |

|    1 	 | Evergreen Needleleaf |
|    2 	 | Evergreen Broadleaf  |
|    3 	 | Deciduous Needleleaf |
|    4 	 | Deciduous Broadleaf  |
|    5 	 | Shrub 		|
|    6 	 | C3 Grassland 	|
|    7 	 | C4 Grassland 	|
|    8 	 | Tundra 		|
|    9 	 | C3 Cropland 	        |
|    10	 |  C4 Cropland 	|

|    17	 |  Ice 		|

The CABLE vegetation parameters are listed in Table 2 along with their value ranges, units, and descriptions. All parameters in Table 2 are of type real and dimension 17, corresponding to the number of vegetation types in Table 1.
The ranges listed are “physically possible” and mostly correspond to the optional checks in the CABLE offline code.

The CABLE distribution provides the default vegetation parameter values from Table 3 in the namelist file pft_params.nml, including the vegetation types from Table 1 in the top part.
The chosen parameter values in offline cases can be checked against the pre-defined realistic parameter value ranges using the CABLE namelist variable [`check%ranges`][nml_desc] in cable.nml. 

## Example pft_params.nml file

!!! Note "Namelist file format explanation"

    The asterisk symbol, in the namelist file, means the following entry is repeated multiple times. It does not mean arithmetic multiplication.
