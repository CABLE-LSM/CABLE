# The Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE) documentation

CABLE is a land surface model, used to calculate the fluxes of momentum, energy, water and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere and to model the major biogeochemical cycles of the land ecosystem.

CABLE can be run as a standalone model, driven by prescribed meteorology. CABLE can be run for a single location, a region or globally. CABLE can also be used as part of an atmospheric model. CABLE provides the land surface component of ACCESS-CM2 and ACCESS-ESM1.5.
