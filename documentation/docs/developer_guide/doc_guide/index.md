# Documentation guidelines

The documentation for CABLE has two parts:

 - inline documentation in the source code. This documentation includes the detailed scientific documentation. It is written using [FORD][ford].
 - the standalone guides such as the User Guide and the Developer Guide. It is written using [Material for MkDocs][material].

All documentation is located in the [CABLE GitHub repository][cable-repo]. Both tools use [Markdown][md-cheatsheet] and [LaTeX Mathematics][latex-maths] for formatting. You can find a cheatsheet for FORD [on this page][ford-cheatsheet].


To update the documentation, you need to follow a traditional GitHub contribution process with opening an issue and a branch, working on your changes and submitting a pull request for review before publication. The process is explained in more details [on this page][git-process].
