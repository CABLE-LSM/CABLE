# Obsolete and deprecated features for CABLE developers #

The obsolete developer features described here were at some point coded in previous
versions of CABLE before they became deprecated and were subsequently removed
from the code. Coding with the deprecated developer features described here is discouraged as they are scheduled to become obsolete
and removed from future versions of the CABLE code. Development that includes any deprecated or obsolete features will require modifications 
before being accepted for a CABLE release.
