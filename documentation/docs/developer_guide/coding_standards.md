## Foreword
Currently not all of the CABLE code is compliant with the standards described here. Work is in progress to apply these standards across the existing code base, however these standards are expected to be met by any new development.

## Introduction
CABLE is a community software project. 
For the benefit of the whole community, developers are required to adhere to certain coding standards that better enable portability, efficient maintenance, future development, performance, readability. 

Submitted developments that are inconsistent with the standards discussed below, and/or poorly commented/documented code will not be accepted without revision. 
## Coding Standards
Generic code examples are given below as well as a link to the JULES coding standards, to which CABLE is somewhat bound through the JULES and CABLE (JAC) project.  
Whilst syntax/text formatting style is relatively trivial, it must still be adhered to. Some more significant general rules that should be followed are: 
## The JAC project 
The JAC project is a long term initiative to include CABLE as an inter-operable Land-Surface Model (LSM) within the Unified Model (UM). For several reasons, CABLE is coupled to the UM via its native LSM, JULES. From a coding standards perspective, both the UM and JULES developments are strictly goverened by the UK Met Office and thus CABLE's coding standards are somewhat constrained by JULES' coding standards. 

The [JULES coding standards](http://jules-lsm.github.io/coding_standards/) are described in this comprehensive document.
### 1. IO must be restricted to the top level
In terms of the offline application of the model this means IO should be restricted to the offline/ directory. Coupled to the UM/JULES there should be no IO code in the CABLE directory. 

### 2. Comment liberally
Detrimental to any model is the lack of meaningful and/or outdated comments. 
Liberal inline commenting is expected aswell as thorough commenting in the MarkDown. See [cable_roughness.F90](https://github.com/CABLE-LSM/CABLE/blob/main/src/science/roughness/cable_roughness.F90) for an example, which is then redered as ?????
### 3. Avoid WHERE loops
WHERE loops effectively replace DO/IF loops. In some circumstances these may improve readability. They certainly make it easier to write code. However they are nightmare to debug and hamper portability. Especially nested WHERE loops. 
Moreover it will not pass JULES coding standards. 
### 4. Variable names
We are not so limited by the number of character spaces available as we once were. Developers are encouraged to name variables meaningfully. Of course commenting might make it clear what the variable corresponds to however it is helpful to be able to understand what is going on whilst reading a line of code.

Please maintain globally consistent names of variables across files/subroutines/modules. 
### 5. File names
To include CABLE code identifiably across applications, please include the "_cbl" suffix in your filename **eg. egName_cbl.F90**. 

Please maintain consistent naming between files/subroutines/modules. 
### 6. MODULE names
Everything should be contained within modules.
Modules should be of the form "*_mod_cbl". Following from the above file egName_cbl.F90 **MODULE egName_mod_cbl**.

### 7. SUBROUTINE names
Subroutines should be of the form "*_cbl()". Following from the above file egName_cbl.F90 **SUBROUTINE egName_cbl()**.

### 8. Miscellaneous
 * The last character of a line MUST not be placed beyond column 80. 
 * SAVE attributes will not be permitted.
 * Intrinsic FORTRAN subroutines, functions, etc should be capitalized
 * Subroutines start on the margin. As do headers. Indentation of two spaces
   occurs in loops 
 * Specify IMPLICIT NONE ! prevents accidents 
 * Recieved arguments need to be (re)declared with the INTENT() attribute 
 * Declare in a MODULE header what is to be PUBLIC
 * Specify ONLY in USE statements. To avoid inadvertent inheritance and
   increase transparency of underlying data flow 
 * It is very useful to label either side of a loop. Especially if it covers
   more than a page.
 * Specify IMPLICIT NONE 
 * All IF constructs must be of the form:
```
IF() THEN 
  Even if they only contain a simple, single line statement following the IF. 
END IF
```
 * In summary, be pedantic, be clear

## Final Note about JAC
The UKMO is in the process of revising their entire suite of models, as part of a major program to create a Next Generation Modelling System (NGMS). 
The specific coding standards required of the NGMS have not yet been strictly defined. 
However, from a technical perspective the necessity of the project can be summarized as follows. 
Excluding a quantum computing breakthrough, we as a community can no longer expect advances in hardware to enable higher performance. This means higher resolution, more sophisticated process description etc. We can however better  organize the software. 
In the main our models (including CABLE), have evolved over decades, involving dozens of developers. A key feature emerging from NGMS is the tight reign on memory. As such it will not be permitted to USE data through MODULEs. Data must be passed through argument lists. There are further rules emerging in this respect which relax the rules slightly to allow time independent scalars to be USEd. Nevertheless it is straight-forward enough to pass these as well. 

## Specific Develoments
Code developments broadly fall into two categories. Bug fixes and new developments. Both can of course involve a wide range of complexity. However, at the extremes a bug fix may be as simple as moving a bracket. Alternatively, the bug fix might require you to rewrite a section, or even several sections of code. 
A new development might be as simple as an alternative section or calculation, or it might be an entirely new model that can be plugged in to CABLE. Either as an alternative model, or an extra feature to be used in the standard model.

In all cases an issue should be raised. The accompanying fix contained should then be implemented in a unique branch, corresponding to the raised issue. A bugfix might simply ivolve reference to this issue. For a more complicated, added feature, it is a requirement that this addition can be isolated, switched off via a configuration switch. So that the model can be run, and return results as if there had been no addition. There is of course every possibility that this feature will be accepted as a standard part of the model. Although this is not the expectation initially and the developer should be mindful of this fundamental requirement. 

We proceed assuming that the "issue" raised requires adding a new and significant feature to CABLE, requiring the addition of new files/modules to CABLE. Lesser modifications are covered under this assumption anyway.

For discussion purposes we assume that you are including a new model to do some new stuff. This can conveniently be added in a single file. 

## Code Template 
Assuming the *new* model is called from eg_driver.F90.

```
MODULE eg_mod_cbl

END DO                              ! DO:over ilen

RETURN
