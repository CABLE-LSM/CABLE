# Developer guide

CABLE is a community model and, as such, we welcome contributions from anyone in the community.

The CABLE code and documentation are hosted on GitHub. Guidelines are given here to use Git and GitHub for CABLE's work. If you are new to Git and GitHub, you might find it useful to follow a Git/GitHub tutorial in addition (e.g [The Carpentries training][sc-git]).

???+ Warning "Code changes are currently not accepted"

    Although one can find the source code for CABLE in this repository, we do not accept any code changes
    other than documentation at the moment. Please use the CABLE SVN repository for code modifications.
    
We recommend you [become a member][cable-lsm-join] of the CABLE-LSM GitHub organisation if you want to contribute to CABLE. This guide assumes you are a member of the organisation in its instructions.

We also ask that you become familiar with this developer guide. It contains important information on:

- the workflow to follow to contribute
- the structure of the documentation and source code
- the required standards for both the code and the documentation
