# Plan your work

## Get your copy of the software

!!! note "First time only"

    You only need to clone the repository on your work machine the first time you work on a development for CABLE. The subsequent times, you can work from the same copy of the repository.

If you are a member of the CABLE-LSM organisation on GitHub, you can simply work from a locally cloned copy of the repository. You do not need to create a fork of the GitHub repository. To become a member of the CABLE-LSM organisation, please open an issue on [the CABLE repository][https://github.com/CABLE-LSM/CABLE/issues/new]
