Existing scripts
----------------
Note: the scripts of Matthias Cuntz use the Python library cablepop.
      Add this scripts directory to your PYTHONPATH if you do not run
      from the scripts directory, e.g. type while in the script directory
          export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}
      The scripts of Matthias Cuntz are slowly moved towards using the Python
      library pyjams, which can be installed via pip or conda/mamba.


# Prepare input
---------------
# Written by Lars Nieradzik.
create_landmask.py
    Generate global landmask file from a list of lat,lon tupels in a file.
    Files are hardcoded in script.
create_latlon_land.py
    Generate a number of random lat,lon points. Same as generate_latlonlist.py
    but using variable land (0/1) instead of variable iveg (1-17).
    Files are hardcoded in script.
generate_latlonlist.py
    Generate a number of random lat,lon points. Same as create_latlon_land.py
    but using variable iveg (1-17) instead of variable land (0/1).
    Files are hardcoded in script.
lnutils.py
    Python utilities used in create_landmask.py.

# Written by Matthias Cuntz.
duplicate_lon.py
    Copies all variables of a single grid cell file into a second (or more)
    grid cell(s) with the same lat/lon.
extract_latlon.py
    Extract a single latitude/longitude point from a netcdf file.
extract_latlon_restart.py
    Generate global landmask from a list of lat,lon tupels, and extract tiles
    from any number of restart files.
set_latlon_land.py
    Sets the land variable of netcdf file to 1 at given latitude/longitude
    points, otherwise 0.


# Run Cable
-----------
compile_cable-pop.sh
    Submit compilation to compile with -xHost on host machine.
    Written by Matthias Cuntz.
reset_restart.bash
    Utility that batch renames restart files.
    Written by Vanessa Haverd.
run_cable-pop.sh
    Full Cable run with biomass spinup, POP, land-use change, etc.
    Written by Matthias Cuntz.
run_cable_site_CNP.py
    Full cable run with spinup at single sites.
    Written by Martin De Kauwe and Vanessa Haverd.


# Output
--------
# Written by Matthias Cuntz
compare_two_cable_runs.sh
    Compare restart and output files of two runs performed with
    run_cable-pop.sh.

    Merge Cable 2D output files from pseudo-parallelised runs.
merge_to_output2d.py
    Merge files of pseudo-parallelised Cable or Casa output in land format
    to combined 2D arrays with latitude/longitude.
nopatch2d.py
    Transform Cable or Casa output with summed patches (from sum_patchfrac.py
    or sum_patchcasa.py) to 2D latitude/longitude output.
pack_output2d.py
    Pack Cable 2D output files by removing masked ocean and land points.
sum_patchcasa.py
    Copy Casa output summing variables weighted with patchfrac.
sum_patchcasa2d.py
    Copy Casa output summing variables weighted with patchfrac and make
    lat/lon grid.
sum_patchfrac.py
    Copy Cable output summing variables weighted with patchfrac.
unpack_to_output2d.py
    Transform Cable or Casa land format to 2D arrays with latitude/longitude.
